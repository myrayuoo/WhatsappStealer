## WhatsApp Stealer ðŸª–

This program steal the victim's WhatsApp data such as profil pictures of conversations and stuff
Actually except that I don't really know how to use the other data but this is still interesting and this could be investigated later

## How to use ðŸ“–

Just download this repository
Make sure you have python and the requirements installed (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Start main.py 

## How it works ðŸ¤”

The victim's payload will actually make a zip of all the WhatsApp data located at `LOCALAPPDATA\\Packages\\5319275A.WhatsAppDesktop_cv1g1gvanyjgm` 
Then, it's gonna uplaod it to the gofile API and send to the webhook the link
